                    and followers to look at(One of the best features of this website) because you can have more expierenced programmers browse your code for errors and offer corrections or solutions. </p>

                <h4>Netlify</h4>
                <p>Netlify is a cloud computing company that offers website hosting and serverless backend services. I use this website personally to deploy sites including this one! Setting up and account is quite easy and can be linked right to your Github
                    to easily update files for the websites you launch! The free version gives you limited storage space for websites while the p[aid version allows for more storage and team coordination.</p>

                    the help you need from people in the field.</p>

                <h4>W3Schools</h4>
                <p>W3Schools is another resource website I found very useful while beginning developing. It is a resource for a number of programming languages. They have exersizes and quizzes you can take to practice your programming skills and offer certificaions
                    for passing their programming tests. I like this website for providing a simple library where you can look up basic and some more advanced coding examples and guides.</p>

                <h4>Sketch</h4>
                <p>Sketch is similar to Figma. Sketch descripes itself as a 'digital design toolkit.'. Personally I have used Figma more often than Sketch. This is your personal prefernce and what you are comfortable with. It's always nice to have a outline
                    of what you are creating!</p>

                    option!
